I present a complete and self-consistent theory which can dynamic  framework unifies quantum mechanics, general relativity, and cosmology. The theory resolves long-standing problems including the nature of dark energy, the quantum-gravity unification, and the matter-antimatter asymmetry, while predicting novel testable phenomena. I derive the mathematical foundations, establish empirical consistency, and outline experimental verification pathways. Finally, I discuss the philosophical implications and potential technological revolutions enabled by this paradigm.
